I have the feeling I may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading.

Very readable, the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed. It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life. The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus. I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter.

One reviewer mentioned that the book is \"a thin book, very readable and has interesting 1-2 page thoughts on various entities like anger, children, religion, speech, silence.\" They found the concise nature of the book to be a positive, as it allows the reader to consume the content slowly and revisit it.\n",

Intrigueing story full of the sort of passion that does not cloud the mind or divert truth but instead is revealing and living. Very readable, the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed. It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life. The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus. I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter.

I thought that was so beautiful I got the book and was not disappointed. You see, if you have ideas and you do not realize them, then they are nothing, and if your ideas do not come from love and joy, then they are bitter and what they produce will be bitter, but if they flow from love and joy, then their realization will be love and joy, thus work is love made visible. He says it WAY better than I do and says much more in just a few paragraphs. But as you can see from the example, what he says is not religious, but positive ways of looking at things.

When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. I have the feeling I may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading.

I am always amazed that there is a chapter that reaches out to you, grabs you and offers both comfort and hope for the future. Gibran offers timeless insights and love with each word. I think that we as a nation should read AND learn the lessons here. It is definitely a time for thought and reflection this book could guide us through.            6\n",

       "7  0.070421          oaf  amazon_reviews_25   ARDQ9KNB8K22N  000100039X  Cool book, I really like the quality of the production. Black clothbound with gold embossing and nice paper, looks to be cotton rag. I am proud to include it in my collection. Intrigueing story full of the sort of passion that does not cloud the mind or divert truth but instead is revealing and living. Very readable, the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed. It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life. The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus. I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter. Excellent for busy people or commuters!            3\n",

Recently a friend (who is 90) and I were talking about work and she said: &quot;work is love made visible,&quot; and told me it was from the Prophet. I thought that was so beautiful I got the book and was not disappointed. You see, if you have ideas and you do not realize them, then they are nothing, and if your ideas do not come from love and joy, then they are bitter and what they produce will be bitter, but if they flow from love and joy, then their realization will be love and joy, thus work is love made visible. He says it WAY better than I do and says much more in just a few paragraphs. But as you can see from the example, what he says is not religious, but positive ways of looking at things. Since I rediscovered the book I have given away many copies and everyone I have given it to sincerely thanked me.            1\n",

From what I do recall it was like a poem all the way through. While the writing was beautiful, I found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that I could not identify with. When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. I have the feeling I may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading. Someday, I would like to read this again and dig deeper.            0"
