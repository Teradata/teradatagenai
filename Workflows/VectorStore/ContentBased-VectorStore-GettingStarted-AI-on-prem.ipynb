It\"s direct and simple wisdom has a depth of complexity that takes a quiet day to sink in, leaving you at peace.  It is best to set time aside for it, relax, absorb, and let it softly clear your mind.     2100001  0.065674,-0.008217,0.007656,0.020233,0.028244,0.037964,-0.032166,-0.052582,-0.040314,-0.004578,0.063721,0.007973,-0.008598,0.016235,0.014275,0.0383,0.046326,0.006302,0.019592,-0.052734,-0.014206,-0.021606,-0.040955,0.012169,-0.035309,0.008766,-0.041412,-0.010414,-0.030518,0.032928,-0.050568,-0.032928,-0.016998,-0.0233,0.02417,-0.047302,0.020508,-0.033356,0.018311,0.024017,0.051971,-0.014435,-0.007912,0.072937,-0.025497,-0.01738,-0.000368,0.000711,0.005825,-0.001736,0.00322,0.031052,-0.008598,0.066406,0.033386,-0.011101,-0.006264,-0.000998,-0.027512,0.017944,-0.043427,0.018677,0.004932,-0.047577,0.024094,0.004379,0.001953,0.039673,0.043884,0.018173,0.003845,0.040894,0.033478,0.032715,0.041534,-0.056366,0.007538,0.051849,0.047455,0.023651,-0.005131,-0.015625,0.031555,-0.007843,0.012711,0.008499,0.018326,0.010315,0.025314,0.023834,0.036316,0.043213,0.012589,0.053284,-0.045471,-0.007843,-0.02536,0.006878,-0.027542,-0.015556,0.006973,-0.015434,0.032166,0.022446,0.020599,-0.017624,-0.018997,0.056427,0.007431,-0.042  0.065657456922763,-0.00821493016314437,0.0076540714773072,0.0202279033699525,0.028236885423859,0.0379544369859575,-0.0321578974842037,-0.0525687547570229,-0.0403038450282344,-0.00457684681597601,0.0637049488774154,0.00797099162598881,-0.00859583419042416,0.0162309104537725,0.0142714041717033,0.0382903523485979,0.0463143306240509,0.00630041254571447,0.0195870648358676,-0.0527207164686936,-0.0142024215525896,-0.0216005575155041,-0.0409446835623193,0.0121659346665819,-0.0353001057722362,0.00876379187174438,-0.0414015684454344,-0.0104113767456475,-0.0305103126103006,0.0329197055387633,-0.0505552620773864,-0.0329197055387633,-0.0169937182564352,-0.0232941308021497,0.0241639116518437,-0.0472900847726731,0.0205028340983041,-0.0333475977268886,0.018306387515801,0.0240109501920699,0.0519579086660309,-0.0144313638681987,-0.00791000699169992,0.0729186273955532,-0.0254905773846528,-0.0173756220318181,-0.000367907301939531,0.000710820901301649,0.00582353270053742,-0.00173556270697561,0.0032191888919709,0.0310441780973541,\n",
       "1     VSDEMO01  amazon_reviews_25  A3FFNE1DR5SI1W  000100039X  Can\"t say enough about Kahlil Gibran\"s work among this piece. Everybody in the whole world should read this! There is almost too much to take in, really appreciate and put towards our daily lives. In my opinion, it is just one of the most beautiful literature pieces ever written. Would recommend to as a gift for anyone spiritual/poetic/philosophy/educational piece or just something to enjoy here and there. 5 stars for sure!      400001  -0.00684,-0.020599,-0.011024,0.08667,0.063721,0.027924,-0.057617,-0.040375,-0.05899,-0.009781,0.04303,0.007797,-0.025238,0.032227,-0.024734,-0.009193,0.00528,-0.029465,-0.003571,-0.031616,0.018845,0.015976,-0.005898,-0.004242,-0.002457,-0.037872,-0.039581,0.016525,-0.000747,0.003094,-0.003378,-0.004665,-0.062744,-0.014473,0.019348,0.012695,-0.006275,-0.02536,0.05191,-0.008377,0.067871,-0.033478,0.035675,0.052948,0.012405,0.000693,-0.017181,0.02449,-0.003361,-0.05188,0.033234,0.060272,-0.027237,0.00367,0.004009,0.010582,-0.017792,0.019775,0.022003,0.005119,-0.020126,0.00985,0.020462,0.027725,0.004353,-0.00192,-0.000443,0.038788,0.016113,0.03833,0.007114,0.0466,0.024475,9.5e-05,0.02449,0.00856,0.010086,0.002844,0.037384,0.037689,0.018631,0.015411,0.021774,0.014763,0.024841,-0.002941,0.083008,0.019791,0.064331,-0.00363,0.053223,-0.016068,0.029602,0.055267,-0.022095,-0.020615,0.009369,-0.03421,-0.03949,-0.011009,-0.006992,-0.026169,0.038574,0.011795,0.013824,-0.028214,-0.029465,-0.007744,0.041046,0.015808,-0.0043  -0.00683977075341581,-0.0205983096125164,-0.0110236305242187,0.0866670952044662,0.0637188643535686,0.0279230641108747,-0.0576150689326841,-0.0403736468083572,-0.0589880229157893,-0.00978067218408773,0.0430285578244857,0.00779673867900338,-0.0252371541337293,0.0322259198933233,-0.0247331710255829,-0.00919269189125023,0.00527982303772449,-0.0294640124633621,-0.00357088031585495,-0.0316149403713442,0.0188443683988481,0.0159754645550542,-0.00589780232509451,-0.00424185782689911,-0.00245691765221384,-0.0378707306978602,-0.0395796734197297,0.0165244461549995,-0.000746974963859885,0.0030938963027878,-0.00337788678436237,-0.00466484364980772,-0.0627418970982927,-0.0144725149289747,0.0193473515405101,0.0126945745196804,-0.00627478968971992,-0.0253591500448282,0.0519082602061133,-0.00837671923996554,0.0678687252639013,-0.0334768779653296,0.0356738043315949,0.0529462254169387,0.0124045842391993,0.000692976773701339,-0.0171804241687774,0.024489179203385,-0.00336088735412727,-0.0518782612115808,0.0332328861431318,0.060269\n",

My favorite chapter is the one on children.      200001  0.031372,-0.017746,0.048126,0.041046,0.001194,0.007206,-0.025269,-0.032776,-0.027908,-0.002501,0.04657,0.038666,-0.011841,0.053925,0.002203,0.02179,0.020416,0.002771,0.002413,-0.016388,-0.012886,-0.025574,-0.053101,-0.024689,-0.003426,0.005047,-0.049713,0.003975,0.002449,0.003098,-0.006001,-0.02182,-0.026184,-0.008316,0.046722,-0.004711,0.029175,-0.01738,0.026199,-0.006737,0.041656,-0.006069,-0.005062,0.046417,-0.010651,0.015137,-0.036896,0.04483,0.000832,-0.009972,0.014229,0.005829,-0.005611,0.033508,0.015327,0.008972,-0.001525,-0.012085,-0.002825,0.019531,-0.049255,0.008606,0.048981,-0.024719,-0.008812,-0.004227,0.00523,-0.0103,0.042358,-0.011978,-0.035889,0.066711,0.058777,0.015579,-0.009903,-0.024628,-0.008514,0.034485,-0.00782,0.027405,-0.022247,0.023712,0.023819,0.002823,0.004684,0.003975,0.084595,0.041077,0.015671,0.009659,0.018692,-0.020111,0.017059,0.026077,-0.016144,0.031799,0.005215,-0.003557,-0.026993,0.001627,0.02179,0.00425,-0.015396,-0.001136,-0.00215,-0.059509,-0.048126,0.039978,0.02124,0.0031  0.0313774250772311,-0.0177490687689833,0.0481343223022703,0.0410530979765404,0.00119420647527139,0.00720724611457756,-0.0252733697015349,-0.0327816678672487,-0.0279128260568457,-0.00250143249133479,0.0465780532272935,0.0386726864094166,-0.0118430476329049,0.0539343251080481,0.00220338095898062,0.0217937680872391,0.0204195304850424,0.00277147918172279,0.00241341727372684,-0.0163908339336243,-0.0128882283419992,-0.0255784224443806,-0.053110182615901,-0.0246932694036643,-0.00342659244914553,0.00504787276440091,-0.0497215967379953,0.0039756873862678,0.00244942349911191,0.00309853572897048,-0.00600203773710518,-0.02182377327506,-0.026188527930072,-0.00831743806395045,0.0467300795122526,-0.00471181466080695,0.0291800451558146,-0.0173830054775684,0.0262035305239824,-0.00673816501164432,0.0416632034622318,-0.00607004949616586,-0.00506287535831135,0.0464250267694069,-0.010652841849343,0.0151396176014933,-0.0369023803279841,0.0448377523336819,0.00083214387556599,-0.00997372443166353,0.0142314605834477,0.005830007993598\n",

It is a masterpiece of spirituality. I\"ll be the first to admit, its literary quality isn\"t much. It is rather simplistically written, but the message behind it is so powerful that you have to read it. It will take you to enlightenment.     1600001  0.031143,-0.023346,0.03891,0.005764,0.019363,0.01825,-0.052032,7.3e-05,-0.040466,-0.033081,0.039642,0.013756,0.004246,0.10321,-0.001138,-0.013092,0.022888,-0.012863,0.026596,-0.03891,-0.003206,-0.00267,-0.055145,-0.025375,0.000914,-0.007252,-0.024765,0.009102,-0.02536,0.0271,-0.037384,-0.006958,-0.032562,-0.022903,0.065186,-0.010239,0.005234,-0.015511,0.033813,-0.011841,0.086975,-0.002317,0.01976,0.054321,0.003054,-0.002766,0.013069,0.022598,-0.010788,-0.031342,0.016617,0.052429,0.014244,0.022705,0.009521,0.015762,-0.004501,0.022675,-0.029602,0.015152,-0.01442,-0.011917,0.023727,-0.017227,-0.015945,-0.01181,-0.0149,-0.01767,0.040039,0.01413,-0.005344,0.041718,0.012672,0.03067,0.025391,-0.032745,-0.000533,0.04657,0.019928,0.041748,-0.000847,-0.007244,0.002138,0.018204,0.014252,0.041229,0.049835,0.024963,0.035828,0.006554,0.012405,-0.011841,0.009003,0.059875,-0.030792,-0.012192,-0.00256,-0.010712,-0.010406,-0.02887,-0.028961,-0.020126,0.010834,0.000845,0.010742,-0.058868,-0.027878,0.047119,-0.000287,-0.006817,-  0.0311433454849669,-0.0233462589889233,0.0389104316482054,0.00576406394295184,0.0193632148035004,0.0182502024564315,-0.0520325772171531,7.3000809825726e-05,-0.0404664489096963,-0.0330813669841759,0.0396424397686497,0.0137561526022286,0.00424604710301414,0.103211144960454,-0.00113801262440652,-0.0130921452361425,0.0228882539080989,-0.0128631426957303,0.0265962950428083,-0.0389104316482054,-0.00320603556577092,-0.00267002961965327,-0.0551456117512282,-0.0253752814976411,0.000914010139461829,-0.00725208045008445,-0.0247652747306042,0.00910210097306518,-0.0253602813312385,0.0271003006339339,-0.0373844147195197,-0.00695807718859454,-0.0325623612266478,-0.0229032540745014,0.0651867231410928,-0.0102391135863782,0.0052340580633952,-0.0155111720713265,0.0338133751046202,-0.0118411313581702,0.0869759648574317,-0.00231702570364667,0.0197602192076212,0.0543216026101817,0.00305403387955845,-0.00276603068462956,0.013069144980992,0.022598250690983,-0.0107881196767114,-0.031342347692574,0.0166171843407409,0.0524295816212738,\n",

The 1972 version originally had a dust jacket but my dust jacket is long gone. This particular rendition has had many re-printings, for a reason: it\"s very popular. The textured paper, old-style typography, and leather cover are better than a plain-old paperback. The size is diminutive, which is perfect for this book.      300001  0.038239,-0.010292,0.051697,-0.012276,0.029404,0.011993,-0.02121,0.026932,-0.035553,0.011223,0.028061,0.038666,0.025803,0.057098,0.040497,-0.010513,0.024551,-0.040588,0.031616,-0.008888,0.007576,0.011314,-0.019547,-0.052887,0.018997,-0.009399,-0.019821,-0.031738,0.04007,0.019348,-0.083252,0.008453,0.002905,-0.002161,0.027679,0.010757,0.031052,-0.026718,-0.006042,-0.047516,0.036133,0.037445,0.034576,0.039185,-0.025528,0.020752,-0.022003,-0.006546,-0.001532,-0.026932,0.02121,0.020157,0.02533,0.051727,0.021454,0.020355,0.011131,0.021423,-0.01532,-0.03418,-0.01857,-0.006176,0.019272,0.011391,-0.011818,-0.003586,-0.0224,-0.043152,0.037872,-0.021271,0.01622,0.041473,0.036316,0.007713,0.025803,-0.044434,0.022446,0.064209,0.019897,0.020874,-0.026764,0.016632,0.037048,0.011246,-0.036224,-0.022705,0.042786,0.004623,2.5e-05,-0.000689,0.025314,-0.013046,0.070435,-0.0112,0.004742,-0.006607,-0.006607,0.034485,-0.032135,-0.009804,-0.045929,0.020737,-0.049286,0.032379,0.054749,-0.036255,-0.028244,0.042419,0.033051,-0.028137,  0.0382301838644419,-0.0102896271433049,0.0516850810753433,-0.0122731697251468,0.0293972208046771,0.0119902349717893,-0.0212051099601143,0.0269257907329467,-0.0355448031311619,0.0112204124979898,0.0280545304380372,0.0386570854180943,0.0257970510278562,0.0570848358558514,0.0404876632746228,-0.0105105761909798,0.0245453396808471,-0.0405786422942537,0.0316087108203194,-0.00888595084042886,0.00757425332663018,0.0113113915176206,-0.0195424933705966,-0.0528748067166698,0.0189926201750256,-0.00939683302758673,-0.0198164301989357,-0.0317306826927915,0.0400607617209704,0.0193435392507446,-0.0832328059594266,0.00845105113120445,0.00290433024206186,-0.00216050177387115,0.0276726185094769,0.0107545199359241,0.0310448408524974,-0.0267118400713972,-0.00604060699571008,-0.0475050450195565,0.0361246694101278,0.0374363669239265,0.0345680283819384,0.0391759657608241,-0.0255221144300707,0.0207472155536206,-0.0219979271311832,-0.0065444907967425,-0.00153164679202712,-0.0269257907329467,0.0212051099601143,0.0201523527329573,0.0253\n",

Realizing extensive use of Biblical imagery and sentence structure, &#34;The Prophet&#34; by Khalil Gibran is a literary classic. Influencing the Free Love movement of the 1960\"s, Gibran\"s master work explores themes of love, longing and loss.     1600002  -0.071167,0.018387,-0.004993,0.040192,0.04422,-0.020905,-0.037079,-0.036804,-0.010696,5.3e-05,0.012978,-0.022003,-0.033295,0.005032,-0.029541,-0.026291,0.026337,-0.013039,-0.018661,0.028091,0.03299,-0.007504,-0.003574,0.021667,-0.039734,0.040863,-0.004948,-0.042145,0.021011,-0.016632,-0.029663,0.007179,-0.017227,-0.029877,0.057098,0.016418,-0.028214,-0.032043,0.094299,-0.026154,0.077576,-0.041321,-0.011459,0.027832,-0.028336,0.024521,-0.026245,0.01915,0.014664,0.004169,-0.009285,0.035553,-0.004761,0.003077,-0.032013,0.013458,-0.020645,0.013779,-0.004036,-0.004253,-0.024124,0.017105,0.023529,-0.039612,-0.017334,0.01828,0.023544,0.041534,0.01413,0.033478,0.00613,-0.004551,0.026703,0.015701,-0.051697,0.003225,0.019806,0.006531,0.025742,0.019974,0.047424,0.019852,-0.014793,-0.042938,0.04184,-0.00795,0.059906,0.026749,0.033478,0.010231,0.020218,0.030807,-0.012886,0.053772,-0.045135,-0.014748,0.009499,0.002033,0.034882,0.003767,0.003447,-0.032867,0.02417,0.005821,0.004971,-0.019531,0.002468,-0.06311,0.0672,0.018372  -0.0711735669902686,0.0183886966747238,-0.00499346073295784,0.0401957087480556,0.044224080434888,-0.0209069290251319,-0.0370824214935598,-0.0368073961177209,-0.0106969869817178,5.30048906162159e-05,0.0129791975550424,-0.0220050303439358,-0.0332980723220171,0.00503246433171317,-0.0295437259187478,-0.0262934260224704,0.0263394302671562,-0.0130402031838649,-0.0186627219582869,0.0280935921188702,0.0329930441779049,-0.00750469243743554,-0.00357432979362935,0.0216689993392745,-0.0397376664857494,0.0408667706651024,-0.00494845658054785,-0.0421488889626494,0.0210129388063644,-0.016633534730734,-0.0296657371763927,0.0071796624478078,-0.0172285896348217,-0.0298797569234091,0.0571032687623527,0.0164195149837176,-0.0282166034687908,-0.0320459567927435,0.0943077015135573,-0.0261564133806889,0.0775831583857276,-0.0413248129274086,-0.0114600573881362,0.0278345682194438,-0.0283386147264357,0.0245232626943439,-0.0262474217777846,0.0191517670811421,0.0146653531320036,0.00416938469771705,-0.00928585678059555,0.0355562806807231,\n",

But as you can see from the example, what he says is not religious, but positive ways of looking at things.

There is much that hints at his birth place, Lebanon where many of the old prophets walked the Earth and where this book project first germinated most likely.Probably becuase it was written in English originally, the writing flows, it is pleasant to read, and the charcoal drawings of the author decorating the pages is a plus.

It doesn\"t care how you picture, name or define &#34;God&#34; or whether you give him a gender and a personality.  It just cuts to the heart of how to live and how to relate to others.  If Jesus and the Buddha teamed up to write a book, it might come out like this.When I first read it, I found some passages difficult to grasp.  Looking back, I now think that it was not because they were hard to understand, but because I did not want to hear gently spoken, intelligently phrased ideas that contradicted my own.

Very readable, the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed. It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life.  The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus.  I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter.

Recently a friend (who is 90) and I were talking about work and she said: &quot;work is love made visible,&quot; and told me it was from the Prophet.  I though that was so beautiful I got the book and was not disappointed.You see, if you have ideas and you do not realize them, then they are nothing, and if your ideas do not come from love and joy, then they are bitter and what they produce will be bitter, but if they flow from love and joy, then their realization will be love and joy, thus work is love made visible.He says it WAY better that I do and says much more in just a few paragraphs.  But as you can see from the example, what he says is not religious, but positive ways of looking at things.  Since I rediscoverd the book I have given away many copies and everyone I have given it to sincerly thanked me.            2\n",

This, the most famous of his works, is no exception. It is simple, yet deep; honest and profound; moving and inspirational. Gibran\"s work is one of a kind, and can be far more encouraging and moving than any self-help program or therapy or anything like that. The poetic style, the aphorisms, the parables, the almost biblical feel, are all just what over-worked, over-stressed, modern and spiritually starved worldly people need.            6\n",

It is a very demanding and assuming title, but Gibran backs it up with some excellent style and content.  If he had the means to publish it a century or two earlier, he could have inspired a new religion.From the mouth of an old man about to sail away to a far away destination, we hear the wisdom of life and all important aspects of it.  It is a messege.  A guide book.  A Sufi sermon. Much is put in perspective without any hint of a dogma.  There is much that hints at his birth place, Lebanon where many of the old prophets walked the Earth and where this book project first germinated most likely.Probably becuase it was written in English originally, the writing flows, it is pleasant to read, and the charcoal drawings of the author decorating the pages is a plus.  I loved the cover.            8\n",

Now, in addition to my beat up hard copy, I have a portable e-copy.  If you were looking for an example of an intelligently designed (pun intended) book of spiritual guidance, this would be it.  It doesn\"t care how you picture, name or define &#34;God&#34; or whether you give him a gender and a personality.  It just cuts to the heart of how to live and how to relate to others.  If Jesus and the Buddha teamed up to write a book, it might come out like this.When I first read it, I found some passages difficult to grasp.  Looking back, I now think that it was not because they were hard to understand, but because I did not want to hear gently spoken, intelligently phrased ideas that contradicted my own.  Now, if I could have only one book, this would probably be it.            9\n",
       "6  0.251055     VSDEMO01  amazon_reviews_25   ARDQ9KNB8K22N  000100039X  Cool book, I really like the quality of the production.  Black clothbound with gold embossing and nice paper, looks to be cotton rag.  I am proud to include it in my collection.  Intrigueing story full of the sort of passion that does not cloud the mind or divert truth but instead is revealing and living. Very readable, the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed. It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life.  The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus.  I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter.  Excellent for busy people or commuters!            7\n",

From what I do recall it was like a poem all the way through. While the writing was beautiful, I found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that I could not identify with. When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. I have the feeling a may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading. Someday, I would like to read this again and dig deeper.            1\n",

Instead, they find it to be insightful, thought-provoking, and full of timeless wisdom. Some even describe it as a treasure, a masterpiece, and a guidebook for life. The language and delivery are praised for their familiar yet penetrating quality, and the book is appreciated for its ability to offer different insights with each reading. While the literary quality may not be exceptional, the message behind it is considered powerful and enlightening. So, it seems that the thickness of the book is not a concern for most readers, but rather the depth of its content that is valued.\n"

It is simple, yet deep; honest and profound; moving and inspirational. Gibran's work is one of a kind, and can be far more encouraging and moving than any self-help program or therapy or anything like that.\"\n",

The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a sermon by Jesus. I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter. Excellent for busy people or commuters!\"\n",

Now, in addition to my beat up hard copy, I have a portable e-copy. If you were looking for an example of an intelligently designed (pun intended) book of spiritual guidance, this would be it. It doesn't care how you picture, name or define 'God' or whether you give him a gender and a personality. It just cuts to the heart of how to live and how to relate to others. If Jesus and the Buddha teamed up to write a book, it might come out like this.\"\n",

It doesn\"t care how you picture, name or define &#34;God&#34; or whether you give him a gender and a personality.  It just cuts to the heart of how to live and how to relate to others.  If Jesus and the Buddha teamed up to write a book, it might come out like this.When I first read it, I found some passages difficult to grasp.  Looking back, I now think that it was not because they were hard to understand, but because I did not want to hear gently spoken, intelligently phrased ideas that contradicted my own.

I though that was so beautiful I got the book and was not disappointed.You see, if you have ideas and you do not realize them, then they are nothing, and if your ideas do not come from love and joy, then they are bitter and what they produce will be bitter, but if they flow from love and joy, then their realization will be love and joy, thus work is love made visible.He says it WAY better that I do and says much more in just a few paragraphs.  But as you can see from the example, what he says is not religious, but positive ways of looking at things.

When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. I have the feeling a may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading.

Now, in addition to my beat up hard copy, I have a portable e-copy.  If you were looking for an example of an intelligently designed (pun intended) book of spiritual guidance, this would be it.  It doesn\"t care how you picture, name or define &#34;God&#34; or whether you give him a gender and a personality.  It just cuts to the heart of how to live and how to relate to others.  If Jesus and the Buddha teamed up to write a book, it might come out like this.When I first read it, I found some passages difficult to grasp.  Looking back, I now think that it was not because they were hard to understand, but because I did not want to hear gently spoken, intelligently phrased ideas that contradicted my own.  Now, if I could have only one book, this would probably be it.            3\n",
       "6  0.291525     VSDEMO01  amazon_reviews_25  A2I35JB67U20C0  000100039X  When I was in college in the 70\"s this book had a revival and I did not read it then.  Recently a friend (who is 90) and I were talking about work and she said: &quot;work is love made visible,&quot; and told me it was from the Prophet.  I though that was so beautiful I got the book and was not disappointed.You see, if you have ideas and you do not realize them, then they are nothing, and if your ideas do not come from love and joy, then they are bitter and what they produce will be bitter, but if they flow from love and joy, then their realization will be love and joy, thus work is love made visible.He says it WAY better that I do and says much more in just a few paragraphs.  But as you can see from the example, what he says is not religious, but positive ways of looking at things.  Since I rediscoverd the book I have given away many copies and everyone I have given it to sincerly thanked me.            1\n",

From what I do recall it was like a poem all the way through. While the writing was beautiful, I found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that I could not identify with. When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. I have the feeling a may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading. Someday, I would like to read this again and dig deeper.            0"
