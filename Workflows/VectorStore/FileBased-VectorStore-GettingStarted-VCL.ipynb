Preliminary evaluation using GPT-4 as a evaluator shows that Vicuna-13B achieves more than90% quality of OpenAIs ChatGPT, and Googles Bard whileoutperforming other models like LLaMA and Stanford Alpacain more than 90% of cases. 13 shows the relative responsequality of Vicuna and a few other well-known models byGPT-4. Another advantage of Vicuna-13B is its relative limitedcomputational demand for model training. The training cost ofVicuna-13B is merely $300.Like Alpaca and Vicuna          70  0.0869140625,0.1044921875,0.427734375,-0.099609375,0.07275390625,0.16015625,-0.08203125,0.000345230102539062,-0.365234375,-0.23046875,-0.494140625,0.62109375,0.028076171875,0.2890625,-0.08642578125,-0.08544921875,0.193359375,0.5859375,-0.33984375,0.0267333984375,-0.060791015625,-0.138671875,-0.046875,-0.0279541015625,0.6015625,0.1845703125,-0.15625,0.03564453125,-0.111328125,-0.26171875,-0.38671875,0.1484375,0.73046875,-0.2177734375,-0.03173828125,-0.1748046875,-0.25,-0.0703125,-0.08837890625,0.10205078125,0.1318359375,-0.51953125,0.3359375,-0.05322265625,0.470703125,-0.361328125,0.158203125,-0.251953125,-0.07177734375,0.37890625,-0.39453125,0.4375,-0.427734375,0.09814453125,0.306640625,-0.10400390625,-0.306640625,-0.03369140625,-0.765625,-0.263671875,0.3125,0.30078125,0.220703125,0.11376953125,0.2412109375,-0.2001953125,0.050048828125,-0.32421875,0.353515625,-0.06640625,0.330078125,-0.263671875,-0.06640625,-0.76953125,0.216796875,0.2333984375,0.11328125,0.1474609375,0.111328125,-0.37109375,-0.2041015625,0.25  0.00708549867603298,0.00851852088017449,0.0348702069674432,-0.00812045915680185,0.00593111967825233,0.0130564245266226,-0.00668743695266034,2.81442077853312e-05,-0.0297750169082734,-0.0187885133431886,-0.0402838464053111,0.0506334512129997,0.00228885490939268,0.0235652540236603,-0.00704569250369572,-0.00696608015902119,0.0157632442455565,0.0477674068047167,-0.0277050959467357,0.0021793879354652,-0.00495586845598936,-0.011304952943783,-0.00382139254437734,-0.00227890336630836,0.0490412043195092,0.0150467331434858,-0.0127379751479245,0.00290585058062027,-0.00907580729289618,-0.0213361083727735,-0.031526488491113,0.0121010763905282,0.0595500338165469,-0.0177535528624197,-0.00258740120192216,-0.0142506096967405,-0.0203807602366791,-0.00573208881656601,-0.00720491719304477,0.00831949001848816,0.0107476665310613,-0.0423537673668488,0.0273866465680376,-0.00433887278476177,0.0383731501331224,-0.0294565675295753,0.0128971998372735,-0.0205399849260282,-0.0058515073335778,0.0308895897337168,-0.0321633872485093,0.0356663\n",

      "Capabilities:\n",
      "LLMs can perform a wide range of language-related tasks, including text generation, summarization, translation, question answering, and even tasks like code generation and task completion. They can adapt to different contexts and domains, and can be fine-tuned for specific applications.\n",
