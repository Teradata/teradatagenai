Intrigueing story full of the sort of passion that does not cloud the mind or divert truth but instead is revealing and living. Very readable, the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed. It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life. The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus. I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter. Excellent for busy people or commuters!</td>\n",

       "\t\t<td>I first read THE PROPHET in college back in the 60\\'s. The book had a revival as did anything metaphysical in the turbulent 60\\'s. It had a profound effect on me and became a book I always took with me. After graduation I joined the Peace Corps and during stressful training in country (Liberia) at times of illness and the night before I left, this book gave me great comfort. I read it before I married, just before and again after my children were born and again after two near fatal illnesses. I am always amazed that there is a chapter that reaches out to you, grabs you and offers both comfort and hope for the future. Gibran offers timeless insights and love with each word. I think that we as a nation should read AND learn the lessons here. It is definitely a time for thought and reflection this book could guide us through.</td>\n",

       "\t\t<td>When I was in college in the 70\\'s this book had a revival and I did not read it then. Recently a friend (who is 90) and I were talking about work and she said: &quot;work is love made visible,&quot; and told me it was from the Prophet. I thought that was so beautiful I got the book and was not disappointed. You see, if you have ideas and you do not realize them, then they are nothing, and if your ideas do not come from love and joy, then they are bitter and what they produce will be bitter, but if they flow from love and joy, then their realization will be love and joy, thus work is love made visible. He says it WAY better than I do and says much more in just a few paragraphs. But as you can see from the example, what he says is not religious, but positive ways of looking at things. Since I rediscovered the book I have given away many copies and everyone I have given it to sincerely thanked me.</td>\n",

       "4          oaf  amazon_reviews_25          ARDQ9KNB8K22N  000100039X  Cool book, I really like the quality of the production. Black clothbound with gold embossing and nice paper, looks to be cotton rag. I am proud to include it in my collection. Intrigueing story full of the sort of passion that does not cloud the mind or divert truth but instead is revealing and living. Very readable, the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed. It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life. The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus. I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter. Excellent for busy people or commuters!           7  0.0634765625,0.06396484375,-0.0169677734375,0.1416015625,-0.216796875,0.07080078125,-0.24609375,0.00037384033203125,-0.255859375,0.259765625,-0.140625,-0.1083984375,-0.158203125,0.296875,0.470703125,0.1865234375,0.06689453125,0.03759765625,-0.34375,-0.1396484375,-0.1669921875,-0.04248046875,-0.330078125,0.62109375,0.034423828125,-0.169921875,0.23828125,-0.416015625,-0.06787109375,-0.46875,0.181640625,0.51171875,-0.236328125,0.12060546875,0.57421875,0.10205078125,0.6171875,-0.259765625,0.33203125,-0.06982421875,0.0771484375,-0.028564453125,-0.234375,0.40234375,0.41796875,-0.375,0.1669921875,-0.1298828125,0.609375,0.050048828125,0.13671875,-0.09521484375,1.3671875,-0.0137939453125,0.158203125,-0.384765625,0.25,-0.09326171875,-0.416015625,0.34375,0.5546875,0.2412109375,-0.2294921875,0.259765625,0.2333984375,-0.01806640625,0.1240234375,0.2236328125,-0.068359375,-0.09228515625,-0.287109375,0.138671875,-0.345703125,-0.54296875,0.1630859375,-0.053955078125,-0.365234375,0.0185546875,0.36328125,-0.357421875,0.09423828  0.00565383286690828,0.00569732388896143,-0.00151131301634664,0.0126123963954108,-0.0193100137915944,0.00630619819770539,-0.0219194751147829,3.32978137594358e-05,-0.0227892955558457,0.0231372237322708,-0.0125254143513045,-0.00965500689579722,-0.0140910911452176,0.0264425414083095,0.0419253452592276,0.0166135704242997,0.00595827002128027,0.00334880869809183,-0.030617679525411,-0.0124384323071982,-0.0148739295421741,-0.00378371891862324,-0.0293999309079231,0.0553205800515949,0.00306611705474642,-0.0151348756744929,0.0212236187619326,-0.0370543507892758,-0.00604525206538655,-0.041751381171015,0.0161786602037683,0.0455785911116914,-0.0210496546737201,0.0107422824471257,0.0511454419344934,0.0090896236091064,0.0549726518751698,-0.0231372237322708,0.0295738949961356,-0.00621921615359911,0.00687158148439622,-0.00254422479010873,-0.0208756905855075,0.0358366021717879,0.0372283148774884,-0.033401104936812,0.0148739295421741,-0.0115686118661354,0.0542767955223195,0.00445782976044692,0.0121774861748794,-0.0084807493003624\n",

The book had a revival as did anything metaphysical in the turbulent 60\\'s. It had a profound effect on me and became a book I always took with me. After graduation I joined the Peace Corps and during stressful training in country (Liberia) at times of illness and the night before I left, this book gave me great comfort. I read it before I married, just before and again after my children were born and again after two near fatal illnesses. I am always amazed that there is a chapter that reaches out to you, grabs you and offers both comfort and hope for the future. Gibran offers timeless insights and love with each word. I think that we as a nation should read AND learn the lessons here. It is definitely a time for thought and reflection this book could guide us through.          23  -0.486328125,0.06787109375,-0.111328125,0.01220703125,-0.0130615234375,0.09912109375,-0.419921875,0.00051116943359375,-0.3984375,0.10107421875,-0.1298828125,0.03515625,-0.26171875,0.2490234375,0.09375,0.0859375,-0.1708984375,-0.470703125,-0.126953125,-0.2392578125,0.00445556640625,0.21875,-0.11083984375,0.5078125,0.0654296875,0.04736328125,0.251953125,-0.5625,-0.2431640625,-0.58984375,0.37109375,0.63671875,-0.224609375,-0.5859375,0.365234375,0.181640625,0.455078125,-0.62109375,0.359375,-0.002044677734375,-0.029052734375,-0.25390625,-0.30859375,0.482421875,0.2001953125,-0.60546875,0.251953125,-0.1962890625,0.1435546875,0.193359375,0.3203125,0.1181640625,1.140625,0.1962890625,-0.040283203125,-0.3671875,-0.059814453125,-0.318359375,-0.392578125,0.2041015625,0.2890625,0.09619140625,0.1552734375,-0.02880859375,0.5703125,0.34765625,-0.138671875,0.640625,-0.240234375,-0.00138092041015625,-0.045166015625,-0.07763671875,-0.451171875,-0.2138671875,-0.09228515625,-0.2138671875,-0.3515625,0.2734375,0.3203125,-0.46875,0.3  -0.0445972637635816,0.00622391532443558,-0.010209012186844,0.00111940923101359,-0.00119776787718455,0.00908960295583038,-0.0385076775468676,4.68752615486942e-05,-0.0365375173002837,0.00926870843279255,-0.0119105142179846,0.00322389858531915,-0.0240001339129314,0.0228359483126773,0.0085970628941844,0.0078806409863357,-0.0156717292341903,-0.0431644199478842,-0.0116418560025414,-0.0219404209278664,0.000408584369319962,0.0200598134197636,-0.0101642358176034,0.0465674240101655,0.00600003347823286,0.00434330781633274,0.0231046065281206,-0.0515823773651064,-0.0222986318817908,-0.0540898540425768,0.0340300406228132,0.058388385489669,-0.0205971298506501,-0.0537316430886525,0.0334927241919267,0.0166568093574823,0.0417315761321868,-0.0569555416739716,0.0329554077610402,-0.000187501046194777,-0.00266419396981235,-0.0232837120050827,-0.0282986653600236,0.0442390528096572,0.0183583113886229,-0.0555226978582742,0.0231046065281206,-0.0180001004346986,0.0131642525567199,0.0177314422192553,0.0293732982217967,0.0108358813562116\n",

Recently a friend (who is 90) and I were talking about work and she said: &quot;work is love made visible,&quot; and told me it was from the Prophet. I thought that was so beautiful I got the book and was not disappointed. You see, if you have ideas and you do not realize them, then they are nothing, and if your ideas do not come from love and joy, then they are bitter and what they produce will be bitter, but if they flow from love and joy, then their realization will be love and joy, thus work is love made visible. He says it WAY better than I do and says much more in just a few paragraphs. But as you can see from the example, what he says is not religious, but positive ways of looking at things. Since I rediscovered the book I have given away many copies and everyone I have given it to sincerely thanked me.           6  -0.1015625,0.1474609375,0.2001953125,0.1826171875,-0.09423828125,-0.240234375,-0.388671875,0.000537872314453125,-0.00689697265625,0.2294921875,-0.058349609375,-0.0634765625,-0.1904296875,0.1220703125,0.490234375,0.1796875,-0.08740234375,-0.03173828125,-0.1455078125,-0.080078125,0.034423828125,0.10302734375,-0.1845703125,0.11767578125,0.2470703125,-0.2470703125,0.2734375,-0.71484375,-0.2060546875,-0.2275390625,0.5703125,0.48828125,0.10595703125,-0.3203125,0.50390625,0.068359375,0.44140625,-0.3359375,0.6796875,0.095703125,0.041259765625,-0.099609375,-0.04296875,0.47265625,0.236328125,-0.349609375,0.212890625,-0.1728515625,-0.0247802734375,-0.083984375,0.28515625,-0.10205078125,0.79296875,0.1416015625,0.08642578125,-0.353515625,-0.06201171875,-0.011474609375,-0.2109375,0.263671875,0.1083984375,0.06494140625,-0.006805419921875,0.443359375,0.140625,-0.046875,-0.1630859375,0.384765625,-0.208984375,-0.1826171875,-0.1494140625,-0.23046875,-0.578125,-0.314453125,0.134765625,-0.091796875,-0.294921875,0.01312255859375,0  -0.010412520022657,0.0151181781098193,0.0205246788908143,0.0187225119638159,-0.00966161713640768,-0.0246296146689771,-0.0398479131636296,5.51444307089331e-05,-0.000707100217884759,0.0235282904358115,-0.00598219299378611,-0.00650782501416062,-0.0195234750424818,0.012515048104155,0.0502604331862866,0.0184221508093162,-0.008960774442575,-0.00325391250708031,-0.0149179373401528,-0.0082098715563257,0.00352924356537172,0.0105627005999068,-0.0189227527334824,0.0120645063724055,0.0253304573628098,-0.0253304573628098,0.0280337077533073,-0.0732881216979319,-0.0211254011998137,-0.023328049666145,0.0584703047426123,0.0500601924166201,0.0108630617544066,-0.0328394862253028,0.051662118573952,0.00700842693832682,0.0452544139446246,-0.0344414123826347,0.0696837878439352,0.00981179771365755,0.0042300862592044,-0.0102122792529905,-0.00440529693266257,0.0484582662592883,0.0242291331296441,-0.0358430977703,0.0218262438936464,-0.0177213081154835,-0.00254055476514347,-0.00861035309565866,0.0292351523713062,-0.0104625802150736,0.08\n",

My feelings defy description.          21  -0.37109375,0.298828125,0.0277099609375,0.078125,-0.2392578125,0.08056640625,-0.197265625,0.000469207763671875,0.0228271484375,0.11328125,-0.2197265625,0.201171875,-0.103515625,0.400390625,0.027099609375,0.1650390625,0.0625,-0.1826171875,-0.2109375,-0.216796875,0.06787109375,-0.05322265625,-0.056396484375,0.54296875,0.07958984375,-0.19140625,0.380859375,-0.74609375,-0.1015625,-0.5859375,0.33984375,0.310546875,-0.12890625,-0.75,0.44921875,0.1064453125,0.73828125,-0.61328125,0.75,0.008544921875,-0.03955078125,-0.373046875,-0.19921875,0.11669921875,0.234375,-0.50390625,0.09619140625,0.000301361083984375,0.1826171875,0.166015625,0.15625,0.02783203125,0.8203125,0.19140625,-0.1494140625,-0.43359375,0.30859375,-0.19921875,-0.498046875,0.2041015625,0.40625,0.373046875,0.306640625,0.21484375,0.1884765625,0.228515625,-0.1435546875,0.328125,-0.146484375,-0.00628662109375,-0.06640625,-0.271484375,-0.578125,-0.625,-0.2216796875,0.107421875,-0.435546875,-0.00162506103515625,0.1630859375,-0.451171875,0.07421875,0.34765625,-  -0.0318895754881056,0.0256795002614745,0.00238122816967104,0.00671359483960118,-0.0205603841962786,0.00692339467833872,-0.016951826969993,4.03209065073704e-05,0.00196162849219597,0.00973471251742172,-0.0188819854863783,0.0172875067119731,-0.00889551316247157,0.0344071735529561,0.00232877820998666,0.0141824690986575,0.00537087587168095,-0.0156930279375678,-0.0181267060669232,-0.0186302256798933,0.00583243551690353,-0.00457363648447831,-0.0048463762748371,0.0466594841352282,0.00683947474284371,-0.0164483073570229,0.0327287748430558,-0.0641148307181913,-0.00872767329148154,-0.0503519612970089,0.0292041375522652,0.0266865394874147,-0.011077431485342,-0.0644505104601714,0.0386031703277068,0.00914727296895661,0.0634434712342312,-0.0527017194908693,0.0644505104601714,0.00073429943558138,-0.0033987573875481,-0.0320574153590957,-0.017119666840983,0.0100284322916543,0.0201407845188036,-0.0433026867154276,0.00826611364625896,2.58971675941647e-05,0.0156930279375678,0.0142663890341525,0.0134271896792024,0.0023917181616079\n",

Very readable, the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed. It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life. The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus. I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter.

From the mouth of an old man about to sail away to a far away destination, we hear the wisdom of life and all important aspects of it. It is a message. A guide book. A Sufi sermon. Much is put in perspective without any hint of a dogma. There is much that hints at his birthplace, Lebanon where many of the old prophets walked the Earth and where this book project first germinated most likely. Probably because it was written in English originally, the writing flows, it is pleasant to read, and the charcoal drawings of the author decorating the pages is a plus. I loved the cover.</td>\n",

Recently a friend (who is 90) and I were talking about work and she said: &quot;work is love made visible,&quot; and told me it was from the Prophet. I thought that was so beautiful I got the book and was not disappointed. You see, if you have ideas and you do not realize them, then they are nothing, and if your ideas do not come from love and joy, then they are bitter and what they produce will be bitter, but if they flow from love and joy, then their realization will be love and joy, thus work is love made visible. He says it WAY better than I do and says much more in just a few paragraphs. But as you can see from the example, what he says is not religious, but positive ways of looking at things. Since I rediscovered the book I have given away many copies and everyone I have given it to sincerely thanked me.</td>\n",

While the writing was beautiful, I found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that I could not identify with. When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. I have the feeling I may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading. Someday, I would like to read this again and dig deeper.</td>\n",

This, the most famous of his works, is no exception. It is simple, yet deep; honest and profound; moving and inspirational. Gibran\\'s work is one of a kind, and can be far more encouraging and moving than any self-help program or therapy or anything like that. The poetic style, the aphorisms, the parables, the almost biblical feel, are all just what over-worked, over-stressed, modern and spiritually starved worldly people need.            4\n",

       "3  0.060580          oaf  amazon_reviews_25   ARDQ9KNB8K22N  000100039X  Cool book, I really like the quality of the production. Black clothbound with gold embossing and nice paper, looks to be cotton rag. I am proud to include it in my collection. Intrigueing story full of the sort of passion that does not cloud the mind or divert truth but instead is revealing and living. Very readable, the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed. It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life. The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus. I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter. Excellent for busy people or commuters!            6\n",

There is much that hints at his birthplace, Lebanon where many of the old prophets walked the Earth and where this book project first germinated most likely. Probably because it was written in English originally, the writing flows, it is pleasant to read, and the charcoal drawings of the author decorating the pages is a plus. I loved the cover.            3\n",

Recently a friend (who is 90) and I were talking about work and she said: &quot;work is love made visible,&quot; and told me it was from the Prophet. I thought that was so beautiful I got the book and was not disappointed. You see, if you have ideas and you do not realize them, then they are nothing, and if your ideas do not come from love and joy, then they are bitter and what they produce will be bitter, but if they flow from love and joy, then their realization will be love and joy, thus work is love made visible. He says it WAY better than I do and says much more in just a few paragraphs. But as you can see from the example, what he says is not religious, but positive ways of looking at things. Since I rediscovered the book I have given away many copies and everyone I have given it to sincerely thanked me.            1\n",

From what I do recall it was like a poem all the way through. While the writing was beautiful, I found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that I could not identify with. When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. I have the feeling I may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading. Someday, I would like to read this again and dig deeper.            0"

       "\t\t<td>Anything I\\'ve read by Gibran is, in my mind, flawless. This, the most famous of his works, is no exception. It is simple, yet deep; honest and profound; moving and inspirational. Gibran\\'s work is one of a kind, and can be far more encouraging and moving than any self-help program or therapy or anything like that. The poetic style, the aphorisms, the parables, the almost biblical feel, are all just what over-worked, over-stressed, modern and spiritually starved worldly people need.</td>\n",

While the writing was beautiful, I found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that I could not identify with. When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. I have the feeling I may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading. Someday, I would like to read this again and dig deeper.</td>\n",

       "\t\t<td>When I was in college in the 70\\'s this book had a revival and I did not read it then. Recently a friend (who is 90) and I were talking about work and she said: &quot;work is love made visible,&quot; and told me it was from the Prophet. I thought that was so beautiful I got the book and was not disappointed. You see, if you have ideas and you do not realize them, then they are nothing, and if your ideas do not come from love and joy, then they are bitter and what they produce will be bitter, but if they flow from love and joy, then their realization will be love and joy, thus work is love made visible. He says it WAY better than I do and says much more in just a few paragraphs. But as you can see from the example, what he says is not religious, but positive ways of looking at things. Since I rediscovered the book I have given away many copies and everyone I have given it to sincerely thanked me.</td>\n",

If you were looking for an example of an intelligently designed (pun intended) book of spiritual guidance, this would be it. It doesn\\'t care how you picture, name or define \"\"God\"\" or whether you give him a gender and a personality. It just cuts to the heart of how to live and how to relate to others. If Jesus and the Buddha teamed up to write a book, it might come out like this. When I first read it, I found some passages difficult to grasp. Looking back, I now think that it was not because they were hard to understand, but because I did not want to hear gently spoken, intelligently phrased ideas that contradicted my own. Now, if I could have only one book, this would probably be it.</td>\n",

This, the most famous of his works, is no exception. It is simple, yet deep; honest and profound; moving and inspirational. Gibran\\'s work is one of a kind, and can be far more encouraging and moving than any self-help program or therapy or anything like that. The poetic style, the aphorisms, the parables, the almost biblical feel, are all just what over-worked, over-stressed, modern and spiritually starved worldly people need.          21  -0.296875,0.09423828125,-0.12109375,0.021240234375,-0.08544921875,-0.0028533935546875,-0.322265625,0.00048828125,-0.462890625,0.263671875,-0.30859375,0.07421875,-0.2177734375,0.302734375,0.267578125,0.0244140625,-0.126953125,-0.58203125,-0.30078125,-0.09814453125,-0.0264892578125,-0.10791015625,0.0517578125,0.83203125,0.1943359375,0.2001953125,0.08349609375,-0.23828125,-0.1142578125,-0.482421875,0.71484375,0.80859375,-0.091796875,-0.4609375,0.396484375,0.2138671875,0.185546875,-0.75,0.52734375,0.076171875,-0.228515625,0.12890625,-0.58984375,0.5703125,0.419921875,-0.423828125,0.0216064453125,-0.055908203125,0.142578125,0.0262451171875,0.1171875,-0.234375,0.88671875,-0.08349609375,0.0322265625,-0.055419921875,0.013427734375,-0.337890625,-0.82421875,0.380859375,0.33984375,0.01226806640625,-0.046630859375,0.38671875,0.173828125,0.013427734375,0.0289306640625,0.2021484375,0.1552734375,0.1171875,-0.003936767578125,-0.34765625,-0.462890625,-0.25390625,-0.328125,-0.0810546875,-0.1474609375,0.205078125,0.419921875,-0.  -0.0266445393153845,0.00845788830241645,-0.0108681673523279,0.00190631161220267,-0.00766906970426362,-0.000256092149053089,-0.0289233485989371,4.3823255452935e-05,-0.0415444461693824,0.0236645579445849,-0.0276962974462549,0.00666113482884612,-0.019545171932009,0.0271704183808197,0.0240151439882084,0.00219116277264675,-0.0113940464177631,-0.0522373204998985,-0.0269951253590079,-0.00880847434603993,-0.00237741160832172,-0.00968493945509863,0.00464526507801111,0.0746748272918012,0.0174416556702681,0.0179675347357033,0.00749377668245188,-0.0213857486610323,-0.0102546417759868,-0.0432973763874998,0.0641572459830968,0.0725713110300603,-0.00823877202515177,-0.0413691531475706,0.0355844834277832,0.0191945858883855,0.0166528370721153,-0.0673125203757081,0.0473291158891698,0.00683642785065786,-0.0205092835519736,0.0115693394395748,-0.0529384925871454,0.051185562369028,0.0376879996895241,-0.0380385857331476,0.00193917905379237,-0.00501776274936105,0.012796390592257,0.00235549998059525,0.0105175813087044,-0.0210351626174\n",

From what I do recall it was like a poem all the way through. While the writing was beautiful, I found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that I could not identify with. When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. I have the feeling I may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading. Someday, I would like to read this again and dig deeper.          13  -0.41015625,0.1787109375,-0.037841796875,0.125,-0.4140625,0.0026092529296875,-0.349609375,0.00054168701171875,-0.333984375,0.2578125,-0.2041015625,0.0546875,-0.12890625,0.33203125,0.0011138916015625,0.259765625,-0.09619140625,-0.61328125,-0.2041015625,-0.134765625,0.1220703125,-0.09228515625,0.09130859375,0.9375,-0.125,0.1015625,0.1337890625,-0.71484375,-0.068359375,-0.30078125,0.45703125,0.92578125,-0.208984375,-0.6171875,0.337890625,0.30859375,0.453125,-0.5859375,0.482421875,0.10205078125,-0.23046875,0.23828125,-0.5859375,0.404296875,0.1513671875,-0.49609375,0.2353515625,-0.1865234375,0.1865234375,0.10595703125,-0.1103515625,-0.068359375,1.171875,0.1533203125,-0.0120849609375,-0.1162109375,-0.1884765625,-0.271484375,-0.51171875,0.2734375,0.42578125,0.30859375,-0.1298828125,0.055419921875,0.2138671875,0.177734375,0.248046875,0.3515625,0.2177734375,-0.1328125,-0.09619140625,-0.166015625,-0.578125,-0.15234375,-0.326171875,-0.1767578125,-0.1708984375,0.2109375,0.322265625,-0.4765625,0.4375,0.1494140625,-0.03466  -0.0368019783088707,0.0160351476917222,-0.00339542061778271,0.0112158410084177,-0.0371524733403837,0.000234119728080985,-0.0313693053204183,4.86038031980993e-05,-0.0299673251943661,0.0231326720798616,-0.0183133653965571,0.00490693044118276,-0.0115663360399308,0.0297920776786096,9.99458488298943e-05,0.0233079195956181,-0.00863094015100895,-0.0550277199475495,-0.0183133653965571,-0.0120920785872004,0.0109529697347829,-0.0082804451194959,0.00819282136161764,0.0841188075631329,-0.0112158410084177,0.0091128708193394,0.0120044548293221,-0.0641405907668889,-0.00613366305147844,-0.0269881174265052,0.0410079186870273,0.0830673224685938,-0.0187514841859484,-0.0553782149790625,0.0303178202258792,0.0276891074895313,0.0406574236555143,-0.0525742547269581,0.0432861363918622,0.00915668269827854,-0.0206792068592702,0.0213801969222963,-0.0525742547269581,0.0362762357616011,0.0135816824711308,-0.0445128690021579,0.0211173256486615,-0.0167361377547483,0.0167361377547483,0.00950717772979159,-0.00990148464024377,-0.00613366305147\n",

       "5          oaf  amazon_reviews_25  A2I35JB67U20C0  000100039X  When I was in college in the 70\\'s this book had a revival and I did not read it then. Recently a friend (who is 90) and I were talking about work and she said: &quot;work is love made visible,&quot; and told me it was from the Prophet. I thought that was so beautiful I got the book and was not disappointed. You see, if you have ideas and you do not realize them, then they are nothing, and if your ideas do not come from love and joy, then they are bitter and what they produce will be bitter, but if they flow from love and joy, then their realization will be love and joy, thus work is love made visible. He says it WAY better than I do and says much more in just a few paragraphs. But as you can see from the example, what he says is not religious, but positive ways of looking at things. Since I rediscovered the book I have given away many copies and everyone I have given it to sincerely thanked me.           8  -0.1015625,0.1474609375,0.2001953125,0.1826171875,-0.09423828125,-0.240234375,-0.388671875,0.000537872314453125,-0.00689697265625,0.2294921875,-0.058349609375,-0.0634765625,-0.1904296875,0.1220703125,0.490234375,0.1796875,-0.08740234375,-0.03173828125,-0.1455078125,-0.080078125,0.034423828125,0.10302734375,-0.1845703125,0.11767578125,0.2470703125,-0.2470703125,0.2734375,-0.71484375,-0.2060546875,-0.2275390625,0.5703125,0.48828125,0.10595703125,-0.3203125,0.50390625,0.068359375,0.44140625,-0.3359375,0.6796875,0.095703125,0.041259765625,-0.099609375,-0.04296875,0.47265625,0.236328125,-0.349609375,0.212890625,-0.1728515625,-0.0247802734375,-0.083984375,0.28515625,-0.10205078125,0.79296875,0.1416015625,0.08642578125,-0.353515625,-0.06201171875,-0.011474609375,-0.2109375,0.263671875,0.1083984375,0.06494140625,-0.006805419921875,0.443359375,0.140625,-0.046875,-0.1630859375,0.384765625,-0.208984375,-0.1826171875,-0.1494140625,-0.23046875,-0.578125,-0.314453125,0.134765625,-0.091796875,-0.294921875,0.01312255859375,0  -0.010412520022657,0.0151181781098193,0.0205246788908143,0.0187225119638159,-0.00966161713640768,-0.0246296146689771,-0.0398479131636296,5.51444307089331e-05,-0.000707100217884759,0.0235282904358115,-0.00598219299378611,-0.00650782501416062,-0.0195234750424818,0.012515048104155,0.0502604331862866,0.0184221508093162,-0.008960774442575,-0.00325391250708031,-0.0149179373401528,-0.0082098715563257,0.00352924356537172,0.0105627005999068,-0.0189227527334824,0.0120645063724055,0.0253304573628098,-0.0253304573628098,0.0280337077533073,-0.0732881216979319,-0.0211254011998137,-0.023328049666145,0.0584703047426123,0.0500601924166201,0.0108630617544066,-0.0328394862253028,0.051662118573952,0.00700842693832682,0.0452544139446246,-0.0344414123826347,0.0696837878439352,0.00981179771365755,0.0042300862592044,-0.0102122792529905,-0.00440529693266257,0.0484582662592883,0.0242291331296441,-0.0358430977703,0.0218262438936464,-0.0177213081154835,-0.00254055476514347,-0.00861035309565866,0.0292351523713062,-0.0104625802150736,0.08\n",

My favorite chapter is the one on children.          25  -0.0703125,-0.205078125,0.0361328125,-0.16015625,-0.3671875,0.10693359375,-0.28515625,0.0004425048828125,-0.0634765625,0.361328125,-0.380859375,-0.125,-0.32421875,0.10400390625,0.134765625,0.11669921875,-0.1337890625,-0.330078125,-0.3046875,-0.047607421875,0.057373046875,0.12890625,-0.1337890625,0.447265625,-0.0732421875,-0.5,0.25390625,-0.7109375,-0.142578125,-0.72265625,0.326171875,0.83203125,-0.49609375,-0.50390625,0.66796875,0.0107421875,0.65234375,-0.478515625,0.255859375,-0.042724609375,0.431640625,-0.1884765625,-0.2412109375,0.439453125,-0.08056640625,-0.5703125,0.166015625,-0.166015625,0.5703125,-0.001190185546875,0.212890625,0.248046875,1.5390625,-0.010009765625,0.203125,-0.404296875,0.38671875,-0.126953125,-0.39453125,0.1416015625,0.201171875,-0.06689453125,-0.326171875,0.302734375,0.4375,0.21875,0.0218505859375,0.36328125,0.1494140625,-0.13671875,0.05322265625,-0.498046875,-0.373046875,-0.55859375,-0.28515625,-0.0546875,-0.40625,0.050048828125,0.5,-0.25390625,0.007476806640625,0.474609375,0.0258789  -0.00539721298470284,-0.0157418712053833,0.00277356778380563,-0.0122936517984898,-0.0281854455867815,0.00820826141423557,-0.0218886971046282,3.39668351901872e-05,-0.0048724839445234,0.0277356778380563,-0.0292349036671404,-0.00959504530613839,-0.0248871487627964,0.00798337753987296,0.0103446582206804,0.00895787432877764,-0.0102696969292262,-0.0253369165115217,-0.0233879229337123,-0.00365436295839255,0.00440397587293461,0.00989489047195521,-0.0102696969292262,0.0343322714860264,-0.00562209685906546,-0.0383801812245535,0.0194899357780936,-0.0545718201786621,-0.0109443485523141,-0.0554713556761126,0.0250370713457049,0.0638670203189836,-0.0380803360587367,-0.0386800263903704,0.051273523354677,0.000824574205996268,0.0500741426914097,-0.036731032812561,0.019639858361002,-0.00327955650112152,0.0331328908227591,-0.0144675292506618,-0.0185154389891889,0.0337325811543928,-0.00618430654497201,-0.0437773942092564,0.012743419547215,-0.012743419547215,0.0437773942092564,-9.13590739598138e-05,0.0163415615370169,0.01904016802\n",

Now, in addition to my beat up hard copy, I have a portable e-copy. If you were looking for an example of an intelligently designed (pun intended) book of spiritual guidance, this would be it. It doesn\\'t care how you picture, name or define \"\"God\"\" or whether you give him a gender and a personality. It just cuts to the heart of how to live and how to relate to others. If Jesus and the Buddha teamed up to write a book, it might come out like this. When I first read it, I found some passages difficult to grasp. Looking back, I now think that it was not because they were hard to understand, but because I did not want to hear gently spoken, intelligently phrased ideas that contradicted my own. Now, if I could have only one book, this would probably be it.          11  -0.271484375,0.1455078125,0.171875,-0.058349609375,-0.2392578125,-0.13671875,-0.1611328125,0.000436782836914062,-0.04833984375,0.03173828125,0.006072998046875,0.041259765625,-0.142578125,0.2578125,-0.0223388671875,0.099609375,-0.042724609375,-0.1962890625,-0.185546875,-0.185546875,0.003997802734375,0.0380859375,-0.0654296875,0.48828125,0.2890625,-0.171875,0.458984375,-0.345703125,-0.138671875,-0.435546875,0.255859375,0.263671875,-0.06298828125,-0.55078125,0.41796875,0.158203125,0.53125,-0.69140625,0.765625,-0.0341796875,0.1591796875,-0.042236328125,-0.25390625,-0.037109375,0.203125,-0.294921875,0.12353515625,-0.1533203125,0.1884765625,0.224609375,0.310546875,0.130859375,0.859375,0.138671875,-0.10498046875,-0.482421875,0.044677734375,-0.169921875,-0.3671875,0.2431640625,0.341796875,0.291015625,0.09716796875,0.19921875,0.1494140625,0.330078125,-0.173828125,0.28125,-0.040771484375,0.06884765625,-0.07275390625,-0.06103515625,-0.33984375,-0.5390625,0.0625,-0.0179443359375,-0.166015625,-0.03173828125,0.12060546875,  -0.0275108847132784,0.0147450425261816,0.0174169629839461,-0.00591286101301578,-0.0242452041537886,-0.0138544023735935,-0.0163284027974494,4.42614138330483e-05,-0.00489852083923483,0.00321620055101277,0.000615407605434174,0.0041810607163166,-0.0144481624753189,0.0261254444759191,-0.00226371038782822,0.0100939217293324,-0.00432950074174796,-0.019890963407802,-0.0188024032213054,-0.0188024032213054,0.000405117569406416,0.00385944066121532,-0.00663032113593401,0.0494800084771195,0.0292921650184547,-0.0174169629839461,0.0465112079684923,-0.0350318460018006,-0.0140523224075019,-0.0441361675615906,0.0259275244420106,0.0267192045776445,-0.00638292109354841,-0.0558134495621908,0.0423548872564143,0.0160315227465867,0.053834249223106,-0.0700636920036012,0.0775846532921234,-0.00346360059339836,0.016130482763541,-0.00428002073327084,-0.0257296044081021,-0.00376048064426108,0.0205836835264817,-0.0298859251201802,0.0125184421447112,-0.0155367226618155,0.0190992832721681,0.022760803899475,0.031469285391448,0.013260642271868\n",

The 1972 version originally had a dust jacket but my dust jacket is long gone. This particular rendition has had many re-printings, for a reason: it\\'s very popular. The textured paper, old-style typography, and leather cover are better than a plain-old paperback. The size is diminutive, which is perfect for this book.          19  -0.055908203125,0.0810546875,0.00628662109375,-0.11083984375,-0.189453125,0.2099609375,-0.1220703125,0.00054931640625,-0.049072265625,0.06591796875,-0.275390625,0.10791015625,-0.134765625,0.1552734375,-0.2265625,0.07177734375,-0.03564453125,-0.1416015625,-0.154296875,-0.050537109375,-0.1484375,-0.0184326171875,-0.2734375,0.333984375,-0.12890625,-0.0986328125,0.279296875,-0.439453125,0.251953125,-0.330078125,-0.04443359375,-0.023193359375,-0.4609375,-0.09423828125,0.609375,-0.0712890625,0.314453125,-0.392578125,0.2353515625,0.1806640625,0.6171875,0.1181640625,-0.330078125,-0.345703125,0.259765625,-0.197265625,0.193359375,-0.0546875,0.5078125,-0.283203125,0.123046875,0.19140625,0.9921875,0.0478515625,-0.11669921875,-0.1279296875,0.125,-0.2109375,-0.1513671875,0.201171875,0.287109375,-0.010498046875,-0.328125,0.05908203125,-0.035400390625,0.00494384765625,0.09326171875,0.0703125,-0.17578125,-0.365234375,-0.03857421875,-0.1494140625,-0.048828125,-0.2490234375,-0.6640625,-0.08154296875,-0.19140625,0.020263671875,0  -0.00521889275987903,0.00756625500558881,0.000586840561427445,-0.0103466258208955,-0.0176849815793281,0.0195993352554409,-0.0113949623578145,5.12773306101651e-05,-0.00458077486784142,0.00615327967321981,-0.0257070350792294,0.010073146724308,-0.0125800384430272,0.01449439211914,-0.0211490501361037,0.00670023786639491,-0.00332732900848183,-0.0132181563350648,-0.0144032324202775,-0.00471751441613519,-0.0138562742271024,-0.00172063931602999,-0.0255247156815044,0.0311766170109804,-0.0120330802498521,-0.00920712958511409,0.0260716738746795,-0.0410218644881321,0.0235192023065291,-0.0308119782155303,-0.00414776629824447,-0.00216504284798475,-0.0430273778631074,-0.00879691094023277,0.0568836520902098,-0.00665465801696365,0.0293534230337301,-0.0366461989427313,0.0219694874258663,0.0168645442895654,0.05761292968111,0.0110303235623644,-0.0308119782155303,-0.0322705333973306,0.0242484798974292,-0.0184142591702282,0.0180496203747781,-0.00510494313630088,0.0474030434085082,-0.0264363126701296,0.011486122056677,0.01786730097\n",

Intrigueing story full of the sort of passion that does not cloud the mind or divert truth but instead is revealing and living. Very readable, the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed. It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life. The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus. I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter.

If he had the means to publish it a century or two earlier, he could have inspired a new religion. From the mouth of an old man about to sail away to a far away destination, we hear the wisdom of life and all important aspects of it. It is a message. A guide book. A Sufi sermon. Much is put in perspective without any hint of a dogma. There is much that hints at his birthplace, Lebanon where many of the old prophets walked the Earth and where this book project first germinated most likely. Probably because it was written in English originally, the writing flows, it is pleasant to read, and the charcoal drawings of the author decorating the pages is a plus. I loved the cover.</td>\n",

Recently a friend (who is 90) and I were talking about work and she said: &quot;work is love made visible,&quot; and told me it was from the Prophet. I thought that was so beautiful I got the book and was not disappointed. You see, if you have ideas and you do not realize them, then they are nothing, and if your ideas do not come from love and joy, then they are bitter and what they produce will be bitter, but if they flow from love and joy, then their realization will be love and joy, thus work is love made visible. He says it WAY better than I do and says much more in just a few paragraphs. But as you can see from the example, what he says is not religious, but positive ways of looking at things. Since I rediscovered the book I have given away many copies and everyone I have given it to sincerely thanked me.</td>\n",

While the writing was beautiful, I found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that I could not identify with. When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. I have the feeling I may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading. Someday, I would like to read this again and dig deeper.</td>\n",

This, the most famous of his works, is no exception. It is simple, yet deep; honest and profound; moving and inspirational. Gibran\\'s work is one of a kind, and can be far more encouraging and moving than any self-help program or therapy or anything like that. The poetic style, the aphorisms, the parables, the almost biblical feel, are all just what over-worked, over-stressed, modern and spiritually starved worldly people need.            4\n",

       "3  0.060580          oaf  amazon_reviews_25   ARDQ9KNB8K22N  000100039X  Cool book, I really like the quality of the production. Black clothbound with gold embossing and nice paper, looks to be cotton rag. I am proud to include it in my collection. Intrigueing story full of the sort of passion that does not cloud the mind or divert truth but instead is revealing and living. Very readable, the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed. It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life. The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus. I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter. Excellent for busy people or commuters!            6\n",

From the mouth of an old man about to sail away to a far away destination, we hear the wisdom of life and all important aspects of it. It is a message. A guide book. A Sufi sermon. Much is put in perspective without any hint of a dogma. There is much that hints at his birthplace, Lebanon where many of the old prophets walked the Earth and where this book project first germinated most likely. Probably because it was written in English originally, the writing flows, it is pleasant to read, and the charcoal drawings of the author decorating the pages is a plus. I loved the cover.            3\n",

Recently a friend (who is 90) and I were talking about work and she said: &quot;work is love made visible,&quot; and told me it was from the Prophet. I thought that was so beautiful I got the book and was not disappointed. You see, if you have ideas and you do not realize them, then they are nothing, and if your ideas do not come from love and joy, then they are bitter and what they produce will be bitter, but if they flow from love and joy, then their realization will be love and joy, thus work is love made visible. He says it WAY better than I do and says much more in just a few paragraphs. But as you can see from the example, what he says is not religious, but positive ways of looking at things. Since I rediscovered the book I have given away many copies and everyone I have given it to sincerely thanked me.            1\n",

From what I do recall it was like a poem all the way through. While the writing was beautiful, I found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that I could not identify with. When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. I have the feeling I may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading. Someday, I would like to read this again and dig deeper.            0"
