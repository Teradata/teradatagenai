## Using the Teradata Package for Generative AI:

Your Python script must import the `teradatagenai` package in order to use the Teradata Package for Generative AI. Let us walkthrough some examples to gain a better understanding. We need a common setup to load the data and import the required packages.

### Common Setup

```python
# Import the modules and create a teradataml DataFrame.
import os
import teradatagenai
from teradatagenai import TeradataAI, TextAnalyticsAI, load_data
from teradataml import DataFrame

load_data('employee', 'employee_data')
data = DataFrame('employee_data')
df_reviews = data.select(["employee_id", "employee_name", "reviews"])
df_articles = data.select(["employee_id", "employee_name", "articles"])

# Define the base directory and script path.
base_dir = os.path.dirname(teradatagenai.__file__)
sentence_similarity_script = os.path.join(base_dir, 'example-data', 'sentence_similarity.py')
```

### Analyze Sentiment of Food Reviews

In this example, we will use the `task` API to perform two tasks: generating embeddings and calculating similarity scores using the Hugging Face model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.

#### Generate Embeddings for Employee Reviews

We will generate embeddings for employee reviews from the `articles` column of a `teradataml` DataFrame using the Hugging Face model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.

```python
# Define the script path for embeddings.
embeddings_script = os.path.join(base_dir, 'example-data', 'embeddings.py')

# Construct the returns argument based on the user script.
returns = OrderedDict([('text', VARCHAR(512))])
_ = [returns.update({"v{}".format(i+1): VARCHAR(1000)}) for i in range(384)]

# Use the task API to generate embeddings.
llm.task(
    column="articles",
    data=df_articles,
    script=embeddings_script,
    returns=returns,
    libs='sentence_transformers',
    delimiter='#'
)
```

#### Calculate Similarity Score

We will calculate the similarity score between employee data and articles using the Hugging Face model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.

```python
# Define the model name and arguments for the Hugging Face model.
model_name = 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2'
model_args = {
    'transformer_class': 'AutoModelForSequenceClassification',
    'task': 'text-similarity'
}

# Create a TeradataAI object with the specified model.
llm = TeradataAI(api_type="hugging_face", model_name=model_name, model_args=model_args)

# Use the task API to get the similarity score.
llm.task(
    column=["employee_data", "articles"],
    data=data,
    script=sentence_similarity_script,
    libs='sentence_transformers',
    returns={
        "column1": "VARCHAR(10000)",
        "column2": "VARCHAR(10000)",
        "similarity_score": "VARCHAR(10000)"
    },
    delimiter="#"
)
```
